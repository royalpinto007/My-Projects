## Based on App Development using Kotlin-

- Simple Chatty Bot - [Link][Link7]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} \
A simple console chat bot showcasing basic Kotlin skills.

- Zookeeper - [Link][Link8]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} \
This project can help the local zoo look after its denizens. A tool to monitor animals and to know their status.
It also helped me understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops on Kotlin.

- Coffee Machine - [Link][Link9]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} \
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy. 
In this project, I have built a coffee machine simulator. 
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. 
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
It helped me get comfortable with functions, loops and conditions in Kotlin.
